# The cogs

### pswdchannel
This cog requires bcrypt and can be CPU intensive. It allows admins of servers to add passwords to channels.

`[p]cog install Tasty-cogs pswdchannel`

### rolenotifier
Allows you to set notification messages that will be sent to the user when a user gains that role.

`[p]cog install Tasty-cogs rolenotifier`

### tempvoice
This cog allows for the creation of temporary voice channels. These channels, once empty, will be deleted.

`[p]cog install Tasty-cogs tempvoice`

### Say
This cog allows servers to permit users to use a fun command "speak". This means that people who are permitted can bet the bot to repeat whatever it wants. This can be set with a role or individual users.

`[p]cog install Tasty-cogs say`
