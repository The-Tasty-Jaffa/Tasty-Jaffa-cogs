# Tasty Jaffa cogs
These cogs are simple to use, open source and can be used along side the discord bot [Red](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/). These are a collection of cogs I have made on various requests. These cogs are intended for use with the open source discord bot [Red](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/)

## The cogs

### pswdchannel
This cog requires bcrypt, Pymongo and can be CPU intensive! It allows admins of servers to add passwords to channels.

`[p]cog install Tasty-cogs pswdchannel`

Once installed, run `[p]setpassword <channel_id>` to set a password for a channel. To enter a password use `[p]enterpassword <channel_id>`

### rolenotifier
Allows you to set notification messages that will be sent to the user when a user gains that role.
This will send a custom notification message to anyone who gets that role!

`[p]cog install Tasty-cogs rolenotifier`

Once installed, run `[p]setroles` for more information about the cog.

### tempvoice
This cog allows for the creation of temporary voice channels. These channels, once empty, will be deleted.
It also allows for admins to set a channel, which upon someone joinng, will create a new channel following a customisable format!

`[p]cog install Tasty-cogs tempvoice`

Once installed, run `[p]setvoice` for more information about the cog.

### Say
This cog allows servers to permit users to use a fun command "speak". This means that people who are permitted can bet the bot to repeat whatever it wants. This can be set to be used with role or even individual users.

`[p]cog install Tasty-cogs say`

Once installed, run `[p]setsay` for more information about the cog
