# Tasty Jaffa cogs
These cogs are simple to use, open source and can be used along side the discord bot [Red](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/) V2. These are a collection of cogs I have made on various requests. These cogs are intended for use with the open source discord bot [Red](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/)

## The cogs

### rolealert
Allows you to set notification messages that will be sent to the user when a user gains that role.
This will send a custom notification message to anyone who gets that role!

`[p]cog install Tasty-cogs rolealert`

Once installed, run `[p]setroles` for more information about the cog.

### tempvoice
This cog allows for the creation of temporary voice channels. These channels, once empty, will be deleted.
It also allows for admins to set a channel, which upon someone joinng, will create a new channel following a customisable format!

`[p]cog install Tasty-cogs tempvoice`

Once installed, run `[p]setvoice` for more information about the cog.

## Support
